We are SMART ISLAND, an Internet of Things (loT) Living Lab and Service Provider for related applications in Ibiza, connecting people, things & territory through cutting-edge technology. 

We have created a game-changing experimental field based on low power wireless technology to explore local and global resilience solutions

One of our key objectives is to inform & engage with society around how these technologies will benefit them and their ecosystem. By building bridges and working together towards long-term goals such as food sovereignty and energy management, we can secure our resilience both in rural and cultural sectors.
